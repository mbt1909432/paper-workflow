## **Abstract** 

Recently, retrieval-augmented text generation attracted increasing attention of the computational linguistics community. Compared with conventional generation models, retrieval-augmented text generation has remarkable advantages and particularly has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks. This paper aims to conduct a survey about retrieval-augmented text generation. It firstly highlights the generic paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation, and then it reviews notable approaches according to different tasks including dialogue response generation, machine translation, and other generation tasks. Finally, it points out some promising directions on top of recent methods to facilitate future research. 

## **1 Introduction** 

Retrieval-augmented text generation, as a new text generation paradigm that fuses emerging deep learning technology and traditional retrieval technology, has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in many NLP tasks and attracted the attention of the computational linguistics community (Weston et al., 2018; Dinan et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2021). Compared with generation-based counterpart, this new paradigm has some remarkable advantages: 1) The knowledge is not necessary to be implicitly stored in model parameters, but is explicitly acquired in a plug-and-play manner, leading to great scalibility; 2) Instead of generating from scratch, the paradigm generating text from some retrieved human-written reference, which potentially alleviates the difficulty of text generation. 

This paper aims to review many representative approaches for retrieval-augmented text generation tasks including dialogue response generation (Weston et al., 2018), machine translation (Gu et al., 2018) and others (Hashimoto et al., 2018). We

firstly present the generic paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation as well as three key components under this paradigm, which are retrieval sources, retrieval metrics and generation models. 

Then, we introduce notable methods about retrieval-augmented generation, which are organized with respect to different tasks. Specifically, on the dialogue response generation task, exemplar/template retrieval as an intermediate step has been shown beneficial to informative response generation (Weston et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019a,b). In addition, there has been growing interest in knowledge-grounded generation exploring different forms of knowledge such as knowledge bases and external documents (Dinan et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Lian et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Qin et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). On the machine translation task, we summarize the early work on how the retrieved sentences (called translation memory) are used to improve statistical machine translation (SMT) (Koehn et al., 2003) models (Simard and Isabelle, 2009; Koehn and Senellart, 2010) and in particular, we intensively highlight several popular methods to integrating translation memory to NMT models (Gu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). We also review the applications of retrieval-augmented generation in other generation tasks such as abstractive summarization (Peng et al., 2019), code generation (Hashimoto et al., 2018), paraphrase (Kazemnejad et al., 2020; Su et al., 2021b), and knowledge-intensive generation (Lewis et al., 2020b). Finally, we also point out some promising directions on retrieval-augmented generation to push forward the future research. 

## **2 Retrieval-Augmented Paradigm** 

In this section, we first give a general formulation of retrieval-augmented text generation. Then, we discuss three major components of the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm, including the re-

trieval source, retrieval metric and integration methods. 

## **2.1 Formulation** 

Most text generation tasks can be formulated as a mapping from input sequence _**x**_ to output sequence _**y**_ : _**y**_ = _f_ ( _**x**_ ). For instance, _**x**_ and _**y**_ could be the dialogue history and the corresponding response for dialogue response generation, the text in the source language and the translation in the target language for machine translation, and so on. 

Recently, some researchers suggest to endow models the capability to access external memory via some information retrieval techniques, so that they can acquire more information in the generation process (Gu et al., 2018; Weston et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019b). The retrieval-augmented generation can be further formulated as: 


where _**z**_ = _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ is a set of relevant instances retrieved from the original training set or external datasets. The main idea of this paradigm is that _**y**[r]_ may benefit the response generation, if _**x**[r]_ (or _**y**[r]_ ) is similar (or relevant) to the input _**x**_ . It is worth noting that _**x**[r]_ = _∅_ when unsupervised retrieval sources are used. In general, the retrieval memory can be retrieved from three kinds of sources: the training corpus, external datasets in the same format with the training corpus, and large-scale unsupervised corpus (§2.2). Metrics that evaluate the relevance between text are varied as well, in §2.3 we divided them into three categories: sparsevector retrieval, dense-vector retrieval, and trainingbased retrieval. Finally, how to integrate the retrieval memory to the generation model is also significant, we also introduce some popular integration approaches in §2.4. 

## **2.2 Retrieval Sources** 

> **Training Corpus** Most previous studies search the external memory from its _training corpus_ (Song et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2018; Weston et al., 2018). In the inference time, retrieved examples with high relevant scores could be regarded as extra references and reduce model’s uncertainty in generation. The main motivation of those works is to to store knowledge not only in the model parameters but also in an explicit and accessible form, making the model be able to re-access it during inference. 

**External Data** Some researchers also propose to retrieval relevant samples from _external datasets_ (Su et al., 2021c; Xiao et al., 2021). In these studies, the retrieval pool is different with the training corpus, which can further provide additional information that are not contained in the training corpus. This is especially beneficial for applications such as domain adaptation and knowledge update. For example, Khandelwal et al. (2020a); Zheng et al. (2021a) employ the in-domain dataset as the external memory to achieve fast domain adaptation for machine translation. 

**Unsupervised Data** One limitation for previous two sources is that the datasets have to be supervised datasets consisting of aligned input-output pairs. For machine translation, Cai et al. (2021) propose a cross-lingual retriever to directly retrieve target sentence from _unsupervised corpus_ (i.e., monolingual corpus in the target language). The main idea is aligning source-side sentences and the corresponding target-side translations in a dense vector space, i.e., aligning _**x**_ and _**y**[r]_ when _**x**[r]_ is absent. As a result, the retriever directly connects the dots between the source-side input and target-side translations, enabling monolingual data in the target 

language to be used alone as memories. 

## **2.3 Retrieval Metrics** 

**Sparse-vector Retrieval** Given an input sequence _**x**_ and a retrieval corpus, retrieval model aims to retrieve a set of relevant examples _**z**_ = _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ from the corpus. When a supervised corpus is used, _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ is retrieved by measuring the similarity between _**x**_ and _**x**[r]_ . For similarity measurement, _sparse-vector retrieval_ methods such as TF-IDF and BM25 (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009) are widely used. They match keywords efficiently with an inverted index. 

**Dense-vector Retrieval** However, these methods prefer examples with similar surfaces, and may fail to retrieve examples that are only semantically relevant. To alleviate above problem, some studies (Cao and Xiong, 2018) attempt to retrieve in _dense-vector space_ instead of the lexical overlap. Recent work (Lee et al., 2019) makes use of pretrained language models, which encodes the text to low-dimensional dense vectors via BERT-based encoders. The retrieval score are computed via inner products between vectors. 

**Task-specific Retrieval** Similarity-based retrieval is based on a simple heuristic. That is, the more _**x**[r]_ resembles with _**x**_ , the more likely _**x**[r]_ and _**y**[r]_ will help the generation. However, the most similar one by universal textual similarity does not necessarily serve the best for downstream models. Ideally, the retrieval metric would be learned from the data in a task-dependent way: we wish to consider a memory only if it can indeed boost the quality of final generation. To this end, Cai et al. (2021) propose to unify the memory retriever and its downstream generation model into a learnable whole. Such memory retrieval is end-to-end optimized for _task-specific_ objectives. 

## **2.4 Integration** 

**Data Augmentation** There are several ways to integrate the retrieved external memory in generation. One straightforward way is _data augmentation_ , which constructs some augmented inputs by concatenating spans from _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ with the original input _**x**_ . By training on the augmented inputs, a generation model implicitly leans how to integrate the retrieved information. Despite the simplicity, this kind of methods works efficiently in lots of tasks (Song et al., 2016; Weston et al., 2018; Bulte and Tezcan, 2019). 

**Attention Mechanisms** Another integration method is based on _attention mechanisms_ (Bahdanau et al., 2014). The main idea of this fashion is adopting additional encoders (in various architectures) to encode retrieved target sentences, and integrate them through attention (Cao and Xiong, 2018; Gu et al., 2018; Bapna and Firat, 2019). Since the attention mechanism is becoming (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017) a key module in lots of NLP models, integrating retrieved memory through attention becomes a very nature and efficient way. 

**Skeleton Extraction** In the previous two methods, the downstream generation model learns how to filter out irrelevant or even harmful information from the retrieved examples implicitly. There also exist some works that try to explicitly extract useful information, i.e., _skeleton extraction_ , from the retrieved memory (Cai et al., 2019a; Wu et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019b). For example, one skeleton should be a part of a whole utterance with irrelevant content masked, and the generation model only integrate this skeleton in the generation process. 

## **3 Dialogue Response Generation** 

**Background** Dialogue systems can be grouped into two categories: chit-chat systems and taskoriented systems. While task-oriented dialogue systems are designed to accomplish specific user tasks such as air tickets booking, chit-chat dialogue systems aim at giving a meaningful and fluent response for any dialogue history in the open domain. Dialogue response generation in chit-chat dialogue system is challenging partly due to the diversity of possible responses to a single dialogue history (i.e., the _one-to-many_ problem). The dialogue history alone cannot decide a meaningful and specific response. Also, external knowledge that is not present in the dialogue history are often necessary for avoiding safe but boring responses. We focus on recent efforts tackling the challenges to develop chit-chat dialogue systems. 

Most modern chit-chat dialogue systems can be categorized into two classes, namely, retrievalbased models and generation-based models. The retrieval-based models (Ji et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2014) directly copy an existing response from curated dialogue corpora (i.e., the retrieval pool) when receiving a response request. The retrieved responses are often informative and grammatical as they are collected from real-world conversa- 

tions and possibly post-edited by a human. However, such systems perform poorly when a given dialogue history is substantially different from those in the retrieval pool. On the other hand, the generation-based models (Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Li et al., 2016a) generate a new utterance from scratch. Those generationbased models have better generalization capacity when handling unseen dialogue contexts. Nevertheless, the generated utterances are inclined to be dull and non-informative (e.g., “I don’t know”, “I think so”, “Me too” etc.) (Li et al., 2016a). 

**Shallow Integration** As discussed, retrievalbased models may give informative but inappropriate responses while generation-based models often do the opposite. It is desirable to combine the best of both worlds. Early work (Qiu et al., 2017) attempts to re-rank the output from both models. For a deep integration, Song et al. (2016) and Yang et al. (2019) extend the standard SEQ2SEQ encoderdecoder model (Bahdanau et al., 2014) with an extra encoder for encoding the retrieval result. The output of the extra encoder, along with the output from the original encoder for dialogue history, is used to feed the decoder. Weston et al. (2018) use a single encoder that takes the concatenation of the original dialogue history and the retrieved as input. Wu et al. (2019) note that the retrieved information should be used in awareness of the context difference, and further proposed to construct an edit vector by explicitly encoding the lexical differences between the input dialogue history and the retrieved dialogue history. Pandey et al. (2018) further propose to weight different training instances by context similarity. 

**Deep Integration** To prevent the inflow of erroneous information, Cai et al. (2019a) propose a general framework that first extracts a skeleton from the retrieved response and then generates the response based on the extracted skeleton. This framework is also adopted for stylistic response generation (Su et al., 2021c). Gupta et al. (2021) suggest to use the semantic structure of an exemplar response, instead of the tokens of the exemplar response, to guide generation. Despite their differences, a common issue is that the generation model easily learns to ignore the retrieved response entirely and collapses to a vanilla seq2seq model. This happens with improper training instances. Due to the one-to-many nature, it hap- 

pens frequently that a retrieved response (extracted skeleton) is suitable for responding to the query, but inconsistent with the current target response. 

Earlier studies (Weston et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019a) alleviate the above problems by putting hard constraints on the data (e.g., discarding data with low similarity of the retrieved response and the target response), which, however, greatly reduces the amount of usable data. Cai et al. (2019b) employ a random mechanism for generating the skeletons used for training, which extract skeletons from the corresponding responses with some deliberate disturbance. Paranjape et al. (2021) propose to model the retriever after the posterior distribution of retrieval given the input and the target output and train it jointly with the standard retriever and the generator by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBo) in expectation over retrieval. 

**Knowledge-Enhanced Generation** The aforementioned work demonstrates that retrieval-based dialogue systems can be used for building better generation-based models. In general, this is done by conditioning the generation on some retrieved responses. More traditionally, to infuse the response with external knowledge, the retrieval pool is not necessarily a dialogue corpus. In fact, knowledge-grounded dialogue response generation exploring different forms of knowledge such as knowledge bases and external documents (Dinan et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Lian et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Qin et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Komeili et al., 2021) has been actively explored. 

**Limitations** We note that there are three major limitations in existing work for dialogue response generation. First, current methods only use one retrieved response for generation. It can be more beneficial to combine multiple retrieval responses. However, this can be difficult due to the one-tomany nature of dialogue response generation. Second, current methods use universal relevance score for retrieval. It can be more effective if we can use more customized retrieval metric especially for controlled dialogue response generation (e.g., persona, emotion, etc). Third, the retrieval pool of existing methods is limited to dialogue corpora (context-response pairs) or documents. It might be useful to enlarge the retrieval pool by including more corpora in other domains or in other modali- 

ties. As discussed, there leaves plenty of possible directions to explore in the future. 

## **4 Machine Translation** 

Retrieval augmented translation originates from human translation scenarios (Somers, 2003). When translating ˆ _**y**_ from an input source sentence _**x**_ , a human translator typically involves a search engine to retrieve similar sentences _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ from a bilingual database. Such a technique called **translation memory** is helpful to improve the translation quality and efficiency for human translators (Dillon and Fraser, 2006). As the development of machine translation techniques, there is a surge of interests in improving machine translation models with translation memory. In the rest of this section, we will review translation memory for both statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (NMT). 

## **4.1 Translation Memory in SMT** 

Generally, SMT includes three key components in a pipeline manner such as phrase table extraction, parameter tuning and decoding (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007). As a result, many efforts have been made to make use of translation memory (TM) on top of each component. 

**Constrained Decoding with TM** Constrained decoding is the most straightforward way to integrating TM into SMT (Smith and Clark, 2009; Koehn and Senellart, 2010; Zhechev and Van Genabith, 2010; Ma et al., 2011). Its basic idea is to reuse the useful segments in _**y**[r]_ while translate other segments by SMT. Specifically, the approach consists of three steps: 1) identify the unmatched segments in both _**x**[r]_ and _**x**_ through the edit-distance algorithm; 2) identify the unmatched segments in _**y**[r]_ , each of which is aligned to one unmatched segment in _**x**[r]_ by a word alignment algorithm; 3) decode each unmatched segment in _**x**_ by SMT and then use the result to replace its corresponding unmatched segment in _**y**[r]_ . Li et al. (2016b) further extend this approach from sentence level to phrase level. The advantage in constrained decoding is that it does not require to change the translation model (including phrase table and parameters) and can be applied in a plug-and-play way. This approach is successful when _**x**_ is highly similar to _**x**[r]_ ; otherwise its performance is degraded largely, because it explicitly isolates TM 

matching and SMT decoding and reuses the results in _**x**[r]_ or not in a deterministic way. 

**Phrase Table Aggregation with TM** There are also notable efforts to augment the phrase table for SMT by extracting translation rules from the retrieved bilingual sentences _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ . Then they re-tune the parameters for the SMT model which makes use of translation knowledge from _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ in a implicit way when translating _**x**_ . For example, Biçici and Dymetman (2008); Simard and Isabelle (2009) directly combine the extracted translation rules into the phrase table in a shallow combination way. They introduce an additional feature to indicate that whether translation rule is from _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ or not and then train all feature weights with MERT (Och, 2003). One characteristic of these work is that a translation rule extracted from _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ which can not exactly match any segments in _**x**_ is useless even if it may contain some useful words in its target side. To remedy this observation, Wang et al. (2013, 2014) resort to a deep combination way to using the extracted translation rules. For each rule in the phrase table, it designs a generative model to reward the rules which are similar to those extracted from _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ . Then this generative model is used as a feature in the loglinear based SMT model whose weight is tuned together with other features by MERT. In addition, Li et al. (2014) employ a similar way to reward the rules but it relies on a discriminative model which is easy to integrate potential features from _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ . 

**Parameter Tuning with TM** Unlike the above two research lines, Liu et al. (2012, 2014) make use of translation memory only in tuning parameters. To be specific, when translating an input sentence _**x**_ , they firstly retrieve many similar bilingual sentences _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ , and then tune the parameters on top of the retrieved sentences as well as a given development dataset in a sentence-wise manner, i.e., it performs an independent tuning for each input sentence. To improve the efficiency of each tuning step, it propose a local update on top of _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ from a baseline model. 

Despite the successes of translation memory in SMT, there are still some limitations for the above three kinds of methods. Firstly, all these methods employ fuzzy score for retrieval which is highly dependent on word matching and thus can not recall such examples which are similar in word seman- 

tics but different in surface form. Secondly, these methods integrate the retrieved examples into a module of SMT in the ways which can not make full use of the knowledge in retrieved examples. For example, the integration ways in the first two kinds (constrained decoding and phrase table aggregation) are heuristic and not optimized towards translation quality; the parameter tuning method fine-tunes few parameters for log-linear based SMT which are not enough to preserve sufficient knowledge from retrieved examples. Thirdly, since SMT performs in a pipeline manner, it is intractable to jointly optimize retrieval metrics as well as SMT models. Consequently, all these methods adopt an off-the-shelf metric for retrieval, leading to suboptimal performance. 

## **4.2 Translation Memory in NMT** 

Translation memory has been widely explored in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Depending on when retrieval is involved, we can categorize previous works into two classes: 1) an NMT model leans how to cooperate with the retrieval model in the training phase; 2) an NMT model is only aware of the retrieved data in the inference phase. 

**Inference Phase** The key point of literature in this line is to reward some target words based on words in _**y**[r]_ in the inference process. Thus, a decision can be made based on both the distribution of generation model and the additional reward of retrieval model. Some previous works propose to reward target words based on the sentence-level similarity between _**x**_ and _**x**[r]_ , and the word alignment between _**x**[r]_ and _**y**[r]_ . Given the input sentence _**x**_ , Zhang et al. (2018) try to assign target words in _**y**_ ˆ with higher rewards, when they appear in _**y**[r]_ and the aligned source words are in both _**x**[r]_ and _**x**_ . He et al. (2019) follow a similar framework and consider the position information of those target words when rewarding. Those works reward the target words in an explicit way, however, the one-sentence-one-model approach (Li et al., 2016c; Turchi et al., 2017) propose to reward target word implicitly. For each testing input _**x**_ , their approach will first finetune the translation model on retrieved memory _{⟨_ _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] ⟩}_ and then translate _**x**_ . 

Others try to reward target words based on tokenlevel similarity score. Most works in this line are based on the dense retriever (Khandelwal et al., 2020a), e.g., faiss. Khandelwal et al. (2020a) build a key-value datastore, where key _h_ ( _**x**[r] ,_ _**y**[r] <t_[)][ is the] 

hidden state at each time step when translating _**y**[r]_ from _**x**[r]_ , and value is its golden-truth target word _**y**[r] t_[.][Therefore, in the inference time, they can use] the _h_ ( _**x** ,_ ˆ _**y** <t_ ) as query and reward target words with similar hidden representations in the datastore. Although this method achieves significant performance gain, one drawback of it is the high latency. To address this issue, Meng et al. (2021) use some heuristics, e.g., pre-filtering, to avoid searching on the entire datastore. The reward score of previous works is got from some non-parametric approaches, however, Zheng et al. (2021a) propose a light-weight network to learn the reward score. Since dense retrieval has the potential of crosslingual retrieval, Zheng et al. (2021b) use a similar approach to achieve unsupervised domain adaptation, where a main change is to create the datastore based on synthetic sources sentence and the real target sentences. 

**Training Phase** Different from those modelagnostic approaches, previous works in this line aim to train the generation model to learn how to cooperate with the retrieval model. It is also worth noting that most works in this line adopt the sentence-level retrieval, when integrating the retrieval information in the training process. To achieve its goal, Bulte and Tezcan (2019) and Hossain et al. (2020) propose a data augmentation method to integrate the retrieved information, where _**x**_ is concatenated with _**y**[r]_ before feeding into the model . Following the data augmentation approach, Xu et al. (2020) propose more matching methods to determine including which retrieved example in the source is better. 

There also exist some works that propose new architectures to integrate the retrieval information. Under the RNN-based framework, Cao and Xiong (2018) and Gu et al. (2018) use the gating and attention mechanism to incorporate the retrieved target sentences. When Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) becomes the backbone of NMT, some works also use additional transformer encoders to encode retrieved target sentences, and integrate them through attention mechanism (Bapna and Firat, 2019; Cao et al., 2019). Xia et al. (2019) represent the retrieved target sentences in a different data structure, i.e., a graph structure, and integrate it through attention mechanism. He et al. (2021) propose a light-weight method to encode the retrieved target sentences and leverage the alignment Dif- 

ferent from previous works that rely on bilingual memories, Cai et al. (2021) propose a framework that can retrieve the most similar target sentence in a monolingual dataset, using a source sentence as query. 

**Limitations** In the section of SMT, we have showed some limitations of the retrieval augmented approaches. There also exist some limitations in the line of NMT. First, the information used for deriving reward scores is limited. The similarity between an input and retrieved examples is the primary feature to derive reward scores. However, some information, e.g., frequencies of words and context, may also be beneficial for integrating the translation memory. Second, it remains to be an open question that when should we use the retrieved information and when not. In the inference phase, approaches tend to integrate the translation memory excessively, e.g., at each time step, which not only reduces the translation efficiency but may also dampen the fluency of generated results. 

## **5 Other Tasks** 

In addition to dialogue system and machine translation, retrieval-augmented generation techniques have shown to be beneficial in many other tasks. In the following, we highlight several key tasks that apply retrieval-augmented generation approaches.[1] 

**Language Modelling** It has been shown that properly leveraging information from retrieval memory could improve the performance of large pre-trained language model. To build a more accurate language model, Khandelwal et al. (2020b) propose to incorporate a soft memory module into the system. Specifically, an index is built by caching the hidden states of the training corpus. Then, the language model accesses the index via k-NN search and displays a greatly improved performance. As another example, Guu et al. (2020) propose a new paradigm that applies retrieval-augmented technique into the pre-training of generative language model. During learning, they train a neural selector that dynamically samples a relevant text to guide the reconstruction of a corrupted input sequence. In this way, the pre-trained model delivers better results by explicitly grounding on the retrieval memory. Lewis et al. (2020a) combine language model pre-training with a paraphrasing 

1Here, we focus on tasks other than question answering. We refer readers interested in QA to Chen and Yih (2020). 

approach. During learning, an input sequence to the model is first corrupted. In the meantime, a set of multi-lingual texts are retrieved based on which the model learns to reconstruct the original input sequence. Recently, Borgeaud et al. (2021) propose RETRO, a large pre-trained language model enhanced with retrieved documents, and obtained comparable performances with GPT-3 using 25 _×_ fewer parameters. 

**Summarization** Text summarization is another research area that benefits from retrieval-augmented text generation. Peng et al. (2019) propose an adaptive decoding framework which first retrieves an exemplar document given the source document. Then, the summarization of the source document is derived through an adaptive generation process based on the retrieved template. Different from Peng et al. (2019), Cao et al. (2018) and Hossain et al. (2020) introduce an intermediate re-ranking stage into the generation pipeline. Specifically, before generating the document summary, the retrieval documents are first re-ranked based on their similarity scores with respect to the source document. Then, the document summarization is produced by re-writing the selected templates. 

**Paraphrase Generation** To address the lack of quality as well as diversity in the generation of paraphrases, Kazemnejad et al. (2020) propose a generation framework which first retrieves a sentence that is similar to input sentence. Then, based on the retrieved sentence, a neural editor produces the resulting paraphrased sentence. Chen et al. (2019) investigate a different aspect of paraphrasing, i.e. how to control the linguistic syntax displayed in the generated text. To achieve this goal, Chen et al. (2019) propose to first extract a sentential exemplar that serves as the syntax template. A neural model then generates the paraphrase with desired linguistic syntax following the retrieved exemplar. 

**Text Style Transfer** To improve the quality of generated text, Li et al. (2018) propose a retrieval-augmented framework which first retrieves texts that are similar to the input based on lexical-level similarity. Then, the retrieved tokens that are irrelevant to the source are deleted, and the output is derived from the edited template. Xiao et al. (2021) also adopte this framework by incorporating retrieval information from two sources (i.e. sparse and dense memories) and obtained an improved 

model performance. 

**Data-to-Text Generation** Recently, retrieval-augmented generation has been adapted to the task of data-to-text generation. To bridge the gap between the structured data and natural language text, Su et al. (2021a) propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework. Specifically, given the source data, a set of candidate texts are first retrieved from a large unlabelled corpus. Then, a neural selector is applied to measure the similarities between the source data and candidate texts, and extract a set of more fine-grained prototypes from the candidates. Lastly, a generation model takes the prototypes as input to produce the text that describes the given structured data. 

While retrieval-augmented generation has been widely explored in the NLP community, we suggest that future research could extend this approach to tasks that involve data from multiple modalities. For instance, with recent advancements in image-text retrieval (Jia et al., 2021; Radford et al., 2021), the structural gap between images and texts is largely bridged. Some early studies (Zhang et al., 2020) have shown that information retrieved from images could improve the performance of neural machine translation model. Naturally, such methods could be extended to other multi-modal tasks, such as image captioning (Karpathy and Li, 2015). A similar idea could also be applied to tasks beyond images, such as speech-to-text transcription (Gales and Young, 2007). 

**Retrieval Efficiency** Generally, if one enlarges the retrieval memory to some extent, it would be possible to retrieve an example which is very similar to the query.Unfortunately, the downside is that the overall inference for the retrieval augmented generation models is less efficient due the considerable retrieval overhead. In this sense, it is urgent to consider some methods to trade off the retrieval memory size and retrieval efficiency, for example, data compression for the retrieval memory. 

**Local vs. Global Optimization** Theoretically, it seems promising to jointly learn retrieval metrics and generation models. However, in practice, there is an essential gap about the retrieval metric between the training and inference phrases. In the training phase, the loss is locally back-propagated to only a few retrieved examples while in the inference phase the metric is globally conducted among all examples in the memory. It would be interesting to narrow such a gap when learning a better metric for generation tasks. 

**Multi-Modalities** With recent advancement in image-text retrieval, directly associating images with relevant text becomes possible. This urges researchers to investigate the possibility of retrievalbased text generation in tasks that involve data from different modalities. One typical task is image captioning. Beyond images, other tasks like speechto-text transcription could potentially benefit from retrieval-based generation methods as well. 

## **6 Future Directions** 

Despite the current success of retrieval augmented text generation, there is still a long way to go as discussed in previous sections. We highlight some directions to facilitate the future research as follows: 

**Retrieval Sensitivity** The performance of retrieval augmented text generation is very sensitive to the retrieval quality, i.e., the similarity between the query and the retrieved examples. Currently, retrieval augmented text generation models perform well when the retrieved examples are very similar to the query. However, they are even worse than the generation models without retrieval when the retrieval examples are less similar. Therefore, it would be important to exploit new methods to address such an issue on similarity. 

**Diverse & Controllable Retrieval** Most of the existing approaches adopt a universal metric for retrieval, such as lexical similarities of sentences. Future work should explore how to use customized metrics for retrieval. This can be beneficial for more controlled text generation. For example, instances with emotions and styles may be more desirable in the personalized dialogue generation, parallel data that contains specific terminologies is more helpful in machine translation, and so on. On the other hand, using a universal metric for retrieval may lead to the lack of diversity of the retrieval results. Collecting a diverse set of retrieval results can improve the coverage of useful information. Thus, considering multiple different metrics for retrieval may lead to generation with higher quality in the future. 

## **7 Conclusion** 

In this paper, we surveyed recent approaches for retrieval-augmented text generation. We reviewed and summarized the development of different components of retrieval-augmented text generation including retrieval metrics, retrieval sources, and integration paradigms. We gave in-depth discussions when retrieval-augmented text generation comes to different applications including dialogue response generation, machine translation, and other generation tasks. We also pointed out some future directions for retrieval-augmented text generation.
